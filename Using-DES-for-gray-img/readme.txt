This encrypts a image in grayscale
Even if u enter a color image it converts it into grayscale and encrypts it
So the decryption will be a grayscale image of the original!

---How to run---
open terminal from current directory and type in the following command
python main.py

then enter the DES key

It will generate the encrypted image in the current directory
It will also decrypt the encryted image and saves in the current directory
